<h1>Linkedin API: Share and Social Stream</h1>
<p>These methods are relative to the tag 'Share and Social Stream'</p><h3>shares</h3>
<p>The Get Network Updates API returns the users network updates, which is the LinkedIn term for the user's feed. This call returns most of what shows up in the middle column of the LinkedIn.com home page, either for the member or the member's connections.<br/><br/>Note: Before using this API make sure you understand LinkedIn's OAuth Authentication Model.<br/>Network Updates<br/>Returns a feed of event items. Each item contains a core set of information, such as when it occured, what type of event took place, and whether you can comment and like the item.<br/><br/>However, the format of the event's information can vary widely from type to type. Information about changing a profile is not similar to the status published by an application. Each event type needs to be parsed differently.<br/><br/>We may perodically add new event types to this feed, or deprecate old ones.<br/>			</p>

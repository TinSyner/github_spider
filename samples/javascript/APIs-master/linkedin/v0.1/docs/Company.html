<h1>Linkedin API: Company</h1>
<p>These methods are relative to the tag 'Company'</p><h3>get_company</h3>
<p>The Company Profile API:<br/><br/>				  Retrieves and displays one or more company profiles based on the company ID or universal name.<br/>				  Returns basic company profile data, such as name, website, and industry.<br/>				  Returns handles to additional company content, such as RSS stream and Twitter feed.<br/>				  Now you can learn all about the companies related to the members using your application. So, not only can you display their profile, but also information about their employer.<br/>			</p>

<h3>company-search</h3>
<p>Use the Company Search API to find companies using keywords, industry, location, or some other criteria. It returns a collection of matching companies. Each entry can contain much of the information available on the company page.<br/><br/>The API can also return facets. Facets provide you with data about the collection of companies, such as which companies are located in a certain area, size of the companies, and the industry a company is in. You can then use this data to make a new API call that further refines your original request. This is similar to clicking the buttons on the left-hand side of the LinkedIn Search results page.<br/>			</p>

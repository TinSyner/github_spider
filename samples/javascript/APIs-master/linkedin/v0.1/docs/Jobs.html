			<td>company-name</td>
			<td>Jobs with a matching company name.<br/>				  It's often valuable to not be too specific with the company name. LinkedIn has made great efforts at standardizing company names, but including suffixes such as "Inc" and "Company" may overly limit your search, missing people who did not include those suffixes on their company names. It's usually better to  search for the basic name of the company and all different versions will be returned. This does increase the possibility of a false positive match return, though, so consider the most specific terms you can use. For example, consider using "Acme" instead of "Acme, Inc" to find people from a company called Acme, Inc. But this runs the risk of finding people from different companies with Acme in the title, such as "Acme Vending" and "Acme Services".<br/>			</td>

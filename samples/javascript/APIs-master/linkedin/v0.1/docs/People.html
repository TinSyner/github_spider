<h1>Linkedin API: People</h1>
<p>These methods are relative to the tag 'People'</p><h3>profile</h3>
<p>The Profile API returns a member's LinkedIn profile.<br/> Displays the profile the requestor is allowed to see. The specific content will depend on the privacy settings of the profile owner, the relationship (degree separation or groups in common) between the owner and requestor, and in rare cases, the privacy settings of the requestor.<br/>			</p>
<p><em>Authentication required</em></p>

<p>The Profile API returns a member's LinkedIn profile.<br/>				  Returns the public profile. The fields returned are only determined by the privacy settings of the profile owner.<br/>                                </p>

			<td>company-name</td>
			<td>Members who have a matching company name on their profile. company-name can be combined with the current-company<br/>					parameter to specifies whether the person is or is not still working at the company. It's often valuable to not be too<br/>					specific with the company name. LinkedIn has made great efforts at standardizing company names, but including suffixes<br/>					such as "Inc" and "Company" may overly limit your search, missing people who did not include those suffixes on their<br/>					company names. It's usually better to search for the basic name of the company and all different versions will be<br/>					returned. This does increase the possibility of a false positive match return, though, so consider the most specific<br/>					terms you can use. For example, consider using "Acme" instead of "Acme, Inc" to find people from a company called Acme,<br/>					Inc. But this runs the risk of finding people from different companies with Acme in the title, such as "Acme Vending"<br/>					and "Acme Services".<br/>			</td>

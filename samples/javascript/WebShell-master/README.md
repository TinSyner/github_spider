WebShell is a universally supported shell available on all browsers. It is designed to bring a shell using the same syntax and commands to all platforms and everyone everywhere. It is developed in javscript, jquery, minimal node.js, and js-git. We plan to release it as a mobile app in react native and a desktop app for linux, windows and mac using electron.js. The (minimal amount of) backend will be written in node.js, meaning the entire program is all javascript! Yay! We also plan to release a chrome app for ChromeOS support. While the live version on our website does not work, you can currently use it by cloning this project and running the index.html file. Please not, however, that this method is not recommended if our website is working.

Paits Server Engine Terminal comes as a tiny webshell. Only the basics!

Once created to manage files remotely from anywhere, now recreated as a tool to quickly delete or create files.
PSE was once used to leak a big security problem by an webhosting giant. They promised they give me $50!
WHERE IS MY MONEY?!

##Installation

First of all: relax! It can't be easier than this installation!
Download this repository and put both files in one folder. Best is /var/www!

For help: type "help" where is the problem, dude?
if in '/var/www': localhost:[80]/terminal.php.

I don't know if i will keep this in development.
